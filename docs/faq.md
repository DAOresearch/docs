### How do we align incentives within the DAOshop?
- We want DAOshop members to collaborate on deals vs hoarding them for themselves. 
- 10% of profits go to the DAOshop DAO. Then everyone is incentivized to help optimize DAOshop services for the good of the guild.
- There's also brand alignment and the opportunity to learn and/or get in on the larger deal if they go through with a full DAOshop.

### How do we split leads between DAO devs/consultants? 
- Random leads are first come first serve. 
- If you source your own lead you form your own team.
- If they lead comes from a DAO platform you find the people who understand that platform.
