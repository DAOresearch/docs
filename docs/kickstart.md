A DAO is only as good as it's people. Good people. Good times. 

It's very very important, esp in the early days, that you curate a strong group of value aligned members. If you think of the DAO architecture as the DNA of your DAO, the initial members are the formative years of the DAO's development. They set the foundation for the rest of the DAO's evolution. 

## How to community 

- have a clear direction with strong goals (meme)
- curate members (onboarding)
- ensure that everyone know what the DAO is about and how to participate to move towards the DAO's goals (user guides and content marketing)

This will be hard. It will take a long time. It will test your patience. Good luck!
