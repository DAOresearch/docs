title: DAO Design Review
---

> Goal: Help people refine their ideas into something they can actually deploy (and use) IRL.

## TL;DR:
- Flat rate fee.
- 2-3 hrs expected work.
- 2-3 day turnaround time.
- There should be no more than 1-2 people involved.
- The cost of a DAO Design Review can act as a credit for a full DAOshop 0 => DAO package (design, development, deployment). 

## Process
People show up with a doc and need help figuring out how to turn their idea into a DAO. 
- They fill out a form which includes their contact info, a doc with their DAO design/goals, and a link to a tx sending 1 DRS (DAO Review Service) token to the DAOshop DAO.  
- Create a Discord or Telegram chat with the client and ask them clarifying questions about their doc (10-15min).
- Review a doc and ask clarifying questions (30-60min).
- Produce summary doc that re-states your understanding of the DAO design goals, comments/concerns, and suggestions for next steps such as design improvements and/or deployment instructions/suggestions (30-60min).
- Hop on a call with the client to discuss the summary doc (30min).
- Client can then use their DAO review as a credit for a full `0 => DAO` project.
