title: Diagram

A picture says a thousand words. This is true for art as well as complex systems. In fact, with complex systems such as DAOs often a diagram is the best thing after a strong meme.

To maximize the utility of our diagram we'll follow the [CadCAD syntax key](https://community.cadcad.org/t/differential-specification-syntax-key/31). This way it'll be easy to translate our design and diagram into a [CadCAD](https://cadcad.org/) model if we want.

## Next Steps 

If appropriate, we can [create a CadCAD simulation to explore how our system might behave in non-intuitive ways IRL](simulation.md).
