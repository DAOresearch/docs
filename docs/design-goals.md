title: Design Goals

## TL;DR: 

What do you want your DAO to do, why, and with whom? 

## Overview

Identifying the design goals of a DAO is arguably the most important part of any DAO design and deployment. Without a strong direction (meme driven development FTW) any organization, esp DAOs, are doomed to chaos. DAOs are all about people and if you're trying to organize people in a DAO there needs to be a clear reason for them to do so. 

> Note: even with a strong direction DAOs are hard, but without one they are nearly impossible. 

## A few things to consider:
- **[Meme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme):** what is the heart of the idea you're excited about? Why is it special? 
- **[Community](https://www.pet3rpan.net/blog/why-do-people-care):** Who would want to be part of your DAO? While startups are all about making things people want, DAOs are all about making something people want to be part of.
- **Results:** what would success look like for your DAO? The clearer you can see this the better. 

## Next Steps 

Once you know what you want to do and why, you'll need to figure out [who can do what and under what conditions](roles-methods-states.md).
