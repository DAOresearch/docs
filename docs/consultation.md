title: Consultation
---

## Overview
The DAO consultation allows us to get a better understanding of the DAO design goals, any preferences the client might have in regards to implementation details, and how we might go from our initial overview to an actual DAO live in the wild. The initial consultation should take no more than 2-3 hours over the course of 2-3 days. If it takes longer than that the client is probably not ready to actually summon and lead a DAO. 

## Process
- Someone has a doc and need help figuring out how to turn their idea into a DAO. 
- Create a chat (we recommend Discord, Telegram, or Discourse) to ask clarifying questions (10-15min).
- Sketch out a doc that restates their goals, but organized in the context of goals, roles, states, methods, mechanisms, etc... (30-60min).
- Share your summary doc and hop on a call to discuss questions, comments, concerns, and suggestions for next steps such as design improvements and/or deployment instructions/suggestions (30-60min).
