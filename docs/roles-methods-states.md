title: Roles, Methods, and States
---

Roles, methods, and states is just a fancy way of saying who can do what and under what circumstances.

Rights and access controls can be broken down into roles, methods, and states:
- **Roles:** bundles of rights determined by "the system state"
- **Methods:** actions that can be taken, mutates "the system state" but access or effect may be dependent on roles
- **State:** all of the information (not limited to smart contract state)

## Why do roles, methods, and states matter?

The moment you create a DAO you have a governance problem. Another way of framing this is as a rights/roles access problem. To more easily reason about this you need a process to describe and discuss the rules of the game. Then you can figuring out what the rules actually are, who can do what when, and how people participating in the system can change the rules of the system. 

For governance to work people need to understand and respect the rules of the system, even if they don't agree with every decision. This is very important. We don't need consensus on the decisions themselves. We need consensus on the way we make decisions. 

For example: if you respect the rules of a game you respect the scores that arise from playing, even if you wish your team won. Once people buy into the idea of the game they can focus on playing the game vs figuring out what the game is or arguing about the rules.

### Questions to ask:
- What are the requirements for participation? 
- What the current rules are and how to change the rules?
- Would you be comfortable being dropped into a random role in the system?

> Warning: no one likes a rigged game. No one likes watching them and no one likes playing them. If everyone's not bound by the same rules and/or if the rules change or are fuzzy things are going to get weird. People get pissed if the rules don't apply equally or if they change in ways that are unfair or unclear. People like it, however, if they feel like they have agency in a system. If there is mobility within the system then people can engage how they want and move into a roles that suites them. 

## Things to consider

What does it mean for the world to be fair? Rights access paradigms are a way to explicitly model and reason through these things. We need to map out rights and access controls to show who can do what and how people can move through the system. This is important because meritocracy and democracy are dependent on rights access controls. If we want to make it so that the rules apply to everyone equally the rules need to change slowly in a participatory way. We have to collectively buy into and accept the trade offs. Everyone can engage in the process and have agency in that process. You should be comfortable being dropped into a random role in society because there's a path towards the role you want. 

## Next Steps 

Once we understand who's going to do what and under what circumstances, then we'll need to [determine the mechanisms that will allow them to do those things](mechanisms.md).
