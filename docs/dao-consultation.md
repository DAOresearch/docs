title: DAO Consultation
---

## Overview
The DAO consultation allows us to get a better understanding of the DAO design goals, any preferences the client might have in regards to implementation details, and how we might go from our initial overview to an actual DAO live in the wild. The initial consultation should take no more than 2-3 hours over the course of 2-3 days. If it takes longer than that the client is probably not ready to actually summon and lead a DAO. 

## Process
- Someone has a doc and need help figuring out how to turn their idea into a DAO. 
- They fill out a form which includes their contact info, a doc with their DAO design/goals, and a link to a tx sending 1 DRS (DAO Review Service) token to the DAOshop DAO.  
- Create a Discord or Telegram chat with the client and ask them clarifying questions about their doc (10-15min).
- Review a doc and ask clarifying questions (30-60min).
- Produce summary doc that re-states your understanding of the DAO design goals, comments/concerns, and suggestions for next steps such as design improvements and/or deployment instructions/suggestions (30-60min).
- Hop on a call with the client to discuss the summary doc (30min).
- Client can then use their DAO review as a credit for a full `0 => DAO` project.
