title: Testing DAO
---

Once you know what you want to build, you need to build it. Often there are non-intuitive bugs and things that happen when you build stuff. A testing DAO allows you to verify that you can, indeed, build the thing you want. 

If you're using a standard DAO design you'll probably be able to deoploy this in a few clicks. If you're building a custom design, however, you'll probably need to work with a DAO technician who has deep domain expertise in the framework you're using to instantiate your design.

## Next Steps 

Once you have a testing DAO live and running you can then use it, or if the testing DAO is on a test network, [deploy it to mainnet](dao-deployment.md).
